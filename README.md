# Iris Dataset Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors Model

Welcome to the "Iris Dataset Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model" repository! This project focuses on using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify the famous Iris dataset, providing insights into its classification performance.

## Dataset Overview

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and classification. It contains information about different species of iris flowers, including measurements of their sepal and petal lengths and widths. The dataset consists of samples from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Model and Analysis

In this project, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on the provided feature measurements. Our analysis comprises the following key steps:

- **Data Exploration**: We explore the Iris dataset, including data statistics, visualizations, and a breakdown of the different iris species.

- **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocess the data, which may include tasks such as feature scaling, data splitting, and encoding categorical target labels.

- **Model Training**: We train a KNN classification model using the preprocessed data.

- **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the KNN model's classification performance using relevant metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Predictions**: We use the trained KNN model to make predictions on new or test data.

## Getting Started

To explore the Iris dataset classification project and analysis, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**: You will need Python, Jupyter Notebook, and essential libraries, including Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, installed on your system.
